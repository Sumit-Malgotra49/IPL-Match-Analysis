# 🏏 Cricket Data Analysis using Python

This project is a step forward in my cricket analytics journey — where I worked with a **raw ball-by-ball dataset**, cleaned it, explored it, and extracted meaningful insights using **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** techniques.

Unlike my previous cricket projects which mainly focused on visualizations, this time I aimed to **understand the data deeper** and tell stories through it.

## 📌 What I Did
- Loaded and cleaned a raw dataset using **Pandas**
- Filtered out relevant columns and dropped unnecessary data
- Analyzed batter-wise stats like:
  - Total balls faced
  - Number of sixes
  - Frequency of outcomes
- Created clean and insightful visualizations using **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib**

## 📊 Key Libraries Used
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `seaborn`
- `matplotlib`

## 📷 Sample Visualizations
*(Add a few screenshots of your plots here if you can — batters vs sixes, total balls faced, etc.)*

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset used is a ball-by-ball cricket dataset. (If it's public, add the source. If not, mention it's local/private.)

## 🚀 Learning Highlights
- Improved my data wrangling and cleaning skills
- Got more comfortable with `.groupby()`, `.agg()`, and `.value_counts()`
- Learned to ask better questions from data and answer them visually

## ✅ What’s Next?
- Explore strike rates and player performance across multiple matches
- Compare bowler vs batter trends
- Build an interactive dashboard in Streamlit (soon 👀)
